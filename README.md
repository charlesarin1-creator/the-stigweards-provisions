# The Stigweard’s Provisions
## A Curated Standard of Use

The Stigweard’s Provisions is a curated collection of foundational goods guided by a single principle:  
**value must be stewarded before it can be multiplied.**

This project documents the philosophy, structure, and public presentation of a stewardship-led provisions platform. It is not a marketplace of excess. It is a deliberate reserve of tools chosen for durability, restraint, and long-term utility.

## The Charter

A steward guards value.

This principle governs both our financial counsel and our curation of physical goods. Every provision represented here is selected not for novelty or trend, but for usefulness over time.

We believe:
- Stability is built long before it is tested
- Tools must justify their place through use
- What endures should be chosen once, and chosen well
